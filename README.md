## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

## Data Engineer and Machine learning Developer

I'm currently working in cloud computing at one of the biggest IT consulting firms. I love being part of great, motivated teams that are eager to grow and learn. I'm always looking to contribute and learn from others. I am passionate about data and data management, with a strong focus on applying machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights and drive data-driven decisions. I consider myself very curious, creative, and proactive.

Always learning.
